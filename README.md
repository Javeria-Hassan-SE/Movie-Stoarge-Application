# Movie-Stoarge-Application

## Project Name: Movie Record Storage with Binary Search Tree and Linked List

## Project Description:
The Movie Record Storage application implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) container class to efficiently store movie records. The application utilizes movie titles as keys for insertion into the BST, supporting both single-word and multiple-word titles separated by dashes. Each node within the BST contains various information about the movie.

## Key Features:

## Binary Search Tree (BST):

Container Class: The application implements a container class for a Binary Search Tree data structure. The BST allows efficient insertion, retrieval, and deletion of movie records based on their titles.
Key-Based Storage: Movie titles serve as the keys for insertion into the BST. This enables fast searching and sorting capabilities based on the titles.
Support for Multiple-Word Titles: The BST implementation handles movie titles that consist of multiple words, with each word separated by dashes. This allows for accurate and comprehensive indexing of movie records.
Movie Record Information:

Data Structure: Each node within the BST holds various information about a movie. This can include details such as the title, director, release year, genre, cast, and other relevant attributes.
Customizable Information: The application allows for the inclusion of additional fields or attributes as needed to suit specific movie record requirements.
Efficient Data Retrieval: The BST structure ensures efficient retrieval of movie records based on their titles, facilitating quick access to relevant information.
Linked List Implementation:

Additional Data Structure: In addition to the BST, the application incorporates a linked list data structure. The linked list can be used to store additional information related to movie records or provide additional functionality as per project requirements.
Complementary Features: The linked list implementation complements the BST by offering additional flexibility and capabilities in managing and manipulating movie records.
Technologies and Techniques Used:

Programming Language: The application is developed using a suitable programming language, such as C++, Java, or Python.
Binary Search Tree: The BST implementation utilizes appropriate data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
Linked List: The linked list implementation employs the necessary data structures and algorithms to support efficient storage and manipulation of additional movie record information.
Key Parsing and Handling: Techniques are used to handle movie titles, including support for both single-word and multiple-word titles separated by dashes.
The Movie Record Storage application offers a robust solution for organizing and managing movie records using a Binary Search Tree and linked list. With support for various movie attributes and efficient search capabilities, this application provides an effective means of storing and retrieving movie information based on their titles.
